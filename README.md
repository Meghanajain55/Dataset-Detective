## Description
This project focuses on basic data analysis using Python and Pandas. The objective is to load a dataset, display the top rows, identify the column with the highest numeric value, count missing values, and extract meaningful insights from the data.

## Objective
To understand how real-world datasets are explored and analyzed using Python libraries.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- CSV Dataset  

## Program Overview
The program loads a CSV dataset and displays the first few rows using the head() function. It identifies the numeric column with the highest value and checks for missing values in each column. Based on this analysis, insights are derived to better understand the dataset.

## Work Summary
In this assignment, basic data analysis was performed using Python and Pandas. The dataset was loaded and its structure was explored by viewing top rows. Numeric columns were analyzed to find the highest value, and missing values were identified to understand data quality. This exercise provided hands-on experience in data exploration and preprocessing, helping build a foundation in real-world data handling.

## Observations / Insights
1. Pandas simplifies dataset loading and inspection.
2. head() helps quickly understand dataset structure.
3. Missing values must be handled before analysis.
4. Numeric columns can be compared to extract useful information.
5. Initial data exploration is essential for data-driven projects.

## Learning Outcomes
- Learned how to load and explore datasets using Pandas  
- Practiced identifying missing values  
- Understood basic data preprocessing concepts  
- Improved analytical thinking  
- Gained confidence in handling real datasets
